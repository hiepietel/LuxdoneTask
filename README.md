Main Concept: 
The application should draw lines between two points selected by the user. The lines must be continuous, but not necessarily straight. The lines may not cross any lines previously drawn. 

What's working: 
  - Window,
  - Drawing lines, 
  - Drawing points.

Todo: 
  - Improve algorithm to detect intersection,
  - Improve algorithm to create Bezier lines.
